/* Because of some disagreement over how this should work,
   this section is wholly dedicated to appeasing everybody.

   Each of the two files detailed below will function as such;
   > dmA.css; Centres button no matter what; Jiiks' Original behaviour.
   > dmB.css; Makes button expand with columns, moves tooltip to suit.

   A complete omission of the import below makes it act like any other server button;
   a satisfiable option for people who don't want the button to move or expand. */
