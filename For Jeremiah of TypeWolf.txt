If you read my E-Mail, you're probably seeing this. If you are seeing this, thank you for your consideration.

There are two ways to use my works;
> Stylish
  - Install for Firefox or Chrome then copy wholesale (sans the meta block) the code for
    any of the selections in ./Fonts, aftter creating a new style for https://discordapp.com
  - Since I cannot use imports for works on userstyles.org, I cannot publish there.
    (Damn you, Jason. Damn you.)
> BetterDiscord
  - Fetch the installer from https://betterdiscord.net
    It's not a virus, honest; Ten minites of research can assure you of that.
  - Extract the installer before running the executable or the installer will crap itself.
  - After installation, themes can go into %appdata%\BetterDiscord\themes

Since I prefer BetterDiscord (for good reason), I'll walk you through what to do after installing a theme;
> ***Wait for BetterDiscord to load after Discord opens***
> Open user settings (<Ctrl> + <,> or by clicking on the cog icon at the bottom left)
> If BetterDiscord finished loading, you should see in the bottom below change log the betterDiscord category
> Within the BetterDiscord category, choose the Themes tab
> Enable whatever you've installed there.

Subsequent installations require you to reload Discord. You can do this easily with <Ctrl> + R.

The Custom CSS tab is also pretty nice. If you choose to detach the editor, it hangs out at the right side of the Discord interface. Since the inspector tools (<Ctrl> + <Shift> + I) also reise there by default, those should be docked to the bottom while the CSS editor BetterDiscord provides is detached.

This matters specifically for this theme; https://github.com/Hebgbs/DiscordStuff/blob/master/Fonts/Triple_Font.theme.css
That theme leaves the variables --headfam, --bodyfam and --monofam open to interpertation by an import or in Custom CSS. The Custom CSS editor makes it easy to play about without neding to restart Discord all the time for every litle change you make, and accepts imports (though I have seen in the past, font imports need to be the first active line or they simply won't work.)

I hope this has been helpful. If you need more information, we can arrange a meeting on Discord. :)
